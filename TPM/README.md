# Trusted Patform Module

## Use Case

There was some discussion on the Slack Channel in regards to whether or not the exact version of the Trusted Platform Module can be detected via a policy. This policy shows the two different ways (PowerShell and WMI) this can be done.

Thanks to the following page (though others may do this better) for providing the scripts: http://www.cistel.com/blog/identify-the-version-of-your-tpm-chip-using-powershell-or-wmicim-in-system-center-configuration-manager/
