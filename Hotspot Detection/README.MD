# Hotspot Detection Policy

## Use Case

Forescout can track when a hotspot is connected via USB to get an extra connection or a connection not on the corporate network. 

This policy will work best when leveraging the SecureConnector since it will capture the event of the device being plugged in.

## Needed for the policy

This leverages the "Hotspot attached to endpoint.xml" file
